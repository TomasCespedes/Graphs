## Graphs

## Implemented Graphs
The folder labeled implemented graphs contains a normal graph, weighted graph, and directed graph that I had to implement for a class during my sophomore year. Within each of the graphs, they have some common algorithms implemented such as Breadth First search, Prim's Algorithm, Topological sort, etc... These were the folders I used to implement some algorithms that gave us information based on whatever the user wants to solve. 

## Examples
The examples contains huffmanTree.py, kclique.py, and transform.py. The Huffman Tree is implemented within the first file which builds a huffman tree based on given frequency inputs. The second file ultizes the normal graph implementation which finds if a certain graph has a clique of k size and returns True or False. The third file is a words transformer which if the user inputs a source word and a target word, it takes the user through the steps of changing that source word to the input word. This only works if both words are real words.
